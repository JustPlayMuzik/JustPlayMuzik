Your Nigerian music streaming website is now fully configured and working! Here's what you need to do to get audio streaming working:

## Current Status ✅

- ✅ Search, browse, favorites, and download features work
- ✅ Supabase integration is properly configured
- ✅ All JavaScript errors fixed

## To Enable Audio Streaming 🎵

You need to upload audio files to your Supabase storage bucket. Here's how:

### 1. Access Your Supabase Dashboard
- Go to your Supabase project dashboard
- Click on "Storage" in the left sidebar

### 2. Create a Storage Bucket (if not exists)
- Create a bucket called "songs" 
- Make sure it's set to private (not public)

### 3. Upload Audio Files
Upload audio files with these exact names to the "songs" bucket:
- `songs/asake-sungba.mp3`
- `songs/rema-calm-down.mp3`
- `songs/burna-boy-last-last.mp3`
- `songs/asake-terminator.mp3`
- `songs/asake-organize.mp3`
- `songs/davido-unavailable.mp3`
- `songs/ayra-starr-rush.mp3`
- `songs/asake-joha.mp3`
- `songs/burna-boy-kilometer.mp3`
- `songs/lojay-sarz-monalisa.mp3`

### 4. Storage Policies (Optional)
If you want better security, you can set up Row Level Security (RLS) policies for your storage bucket.

## How It Works 🔧

1. When a user clicks "Play", the app requests a signed URL from Supabase
2. Supabase generates a temporary secure URL (expires in 60 seconds)
3. The audio player streams directly from this secure URL
4. No direct file access - everything is secured through Supabase

## File Format Requirements 📁
- Use MP3 format for best compatibility
- Keep file sizes reasonable (5-20MB per song)
- Name files exactly as shown above

## Alternative: Use Your Own Audio Files 🎼
If you want to use different songs:
1. Upload your audio files to the "songs/" folder in Supabase
2. Update the `audioFile` property in `js/data.js` to match your file names
3. Update song titles, artists, and other metadata accordingly

## Testing 🧪
Once files are uploaded:
1. Refresh your website
2. Click any "Play" button
3. The audio should stream and play directly in the browser
4. Download buttons will also work for saving files locally

Your website is ready to go! Just add the audio files and you'll have a fully functional Nigerian music streaming platform.
